Vercel deployment helper files added automatically.

Could not detect Node/Next.js build; using @vercel/static fallback.

If this is a Node/React app, ensure package.json has a 'build' script.
For Next.js projects, no additional config is usually required.
If your build output folder is not 'build', edit vercel.json's distDir accordingly.

To deploy:
1. Install Vercel CLI: npm i -g vercel
2. From this project root run: vercel
3. Follow prompts to deploy.
